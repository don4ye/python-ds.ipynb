# Project Name: Python Data Structures and Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the **Web Mining and Applied NLP** course assignment. The tasks included setting up a GitHub repository, creating a Jupyter Notebook with code for various Python exercises, and exporting the notebook as HTML.

## Files
- `python-ds.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code and answers for the assignment.
- `index.html`: HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook for web viewing.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Cloned the Base Repository**: Copied the provided template repository and set it up in my GitHub account.
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**: Created and activated a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the project.
3. **Pattern Drawing Code**: Added Python code to draw a specific pattern using loops.
4. **Data Analysis Tasks**: Included code for calculating mean, variance, unique values, and more as part of the assignment questions.
5. **Exported to HTML**: Converted the Jupyter Notebook to an HTML file for web viewing.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Activate the virtual environment (`.venv`) as outlined in the setup instructions.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`python-ds.ipynb`) to review and execute the code.

## Key Learnings
- Practiced using list comprehensions, loops, and Python functions.
- Learned to structure code and documentation in a GitHub repository.
- Gained experience with Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown formatting, and exporting files to HTML.
